### Hetionet-Knowledge-Network-Analytics  

During the in class presentation illustrated by A.Z. Senior Data Scientist we have been furtherly informed about __network biology__, exploring in detail the applications of this discipline in the realm of drug discovery, diagnosis assistance, biological predictions, and other valuable applications. Furthermore, in the project we dealt with the famous __Hetionet__ integrative network (__[hetionet](https://het.io)__). 
The network combines over 50 years of biomedical information into a single resource, consisting of 47,031 nodes (11 types) and 2,250,197 relationships (24 types). We were required to compute different types of metrics and analysis to gain insights from the knowledge graph. In particular, we analysed the similarities between diseases and/or symptoms such as: _type 1 diabetes mellitus_ and _type 2 diabetes mellitus_, _eye pain_ and _blindess_ ,and others. Lastly, we were required an imaginary patient with one symptom. We Tried to help
them with some data analysis (e.g., study the possible diseases, select the disease, the gene, the possible compounds, the side effects, try to mitigate side effects, and so on...).
